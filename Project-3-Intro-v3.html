<h2>Stat 602 Project 3</h2>
<p>With your group, you will prepare and present a (roughly) 30-minute
power point presentation on the problem background, model building
process, and your recommendations. Provide a short white paper of your
model building process, the selected model, and the model’s properties.
Include annotated code that replicates your analysis. Only discuss your
work on this project with your group, the instructors or GTA’s of the
course.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>From a personal communication from Dr.&#160;Jack Hietpas of John Jay
College of Criminal Justice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small arms propellants (SAP) also known as canister powders are
readily accessible and cost-effective materials that firearms
enthusiasts can acquire for the legitimate assembly of ammunition. These
attributes also make the these materials advantageous for the
construction of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). For this project,
204 one-pound canisters of smokeless propellant (powder) were acquired
from local and online sources. These samples represent nine
manufacturers and 154 unique brands. From each brand a single sample of
particles was collected and analyzed with a high-throughput,
non-destructive, and low-cost quantitative automated image analysis
routine that provided size measurements and four shape measurements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a recent publication on this work with some additional
background. (Janean performed the statistical analysis on this
paper.)</p>

<h3>The Task (this includes both Projects 3 and 4).</h3>
<p>Consider the setting where 12 sets of SAP particles from IEDs are
recovered; some exploded and some are unexploded.</p>
<p>There are 5 lots of SAP particles of interest; each from a different
brand.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the investigators are interested in whether or not the
sets of recovered SAP particles are from one of the five lots of SAP
particles. Figuring out which specific lot would be particularly useful.
<strong>We will return to this task for Project 4.</strong></p>
<p>Dr.&#160;Hietpas suspects that the post-blast recovered sample will tend
to have fewer smaller particles due to those particles being more easily
consumed in the blast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your specific task for Project 3 is to build a predictive model for
whether a particle came from an exploded IED or unexploded IED and to
interpret whether or not Dr.&#160;Hietpas’ suspicion is reasonable.</p>

<h3>Data Resources</h3>
<p>For these projects, you will be given the following data sets:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p><code>unexploded_watchlist.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>exploded_watchlist.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>background_data.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_1.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_2.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_3.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_4.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_5.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_6.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_7.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_8.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_9.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_10.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_11.csv</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>query_12.csv</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first and second data sets, <code>unexploded_watchlist.csv</code>
and <code>exploded_watchlist.csv</code> are data sets of five different
lots of SAPs (each from a different brand as well), with five samples of
SAP particles per brand for <code>unexploded_watchlist.csv</code>. The
<code>exploded_watchlist.csv</code> contains particles from one sample
per lot (same lots as above) that was exploded in some vaguely defined
manner. The <code>background_data.csv</code> data set has one sample per
lot from a number of lots that are not of interest to the examiners
(typically, lot and brand are equivalent in this data set). For these
data sets, each row of these data sets corresponds to 1 SAP particle.
The 13 columns of correspond to the features recorded for each particle
and are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Particle: The individual SAP particle.</p></li>
<li><p>Sample: The scoop of particles from one of the SAP containers.
The lot that a scoop is from is the first 6 characters. The characters
after the first 6 are the container that the scoop was from,
i.e.&#160;SP-007.B is the scoop from the <span class="math inline">\(B^{th}\)</span> container of the lot SP-007. If
there is not a trailing text string then the scoop is either the first
scoop or the only scoop from a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributor: The distributor of the brand of SAP.</p></li>
<li><p>Brand: The brand of the SAP, this is the main class variable of
interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Shape: The examiner explained that they think this is the claimed
shape of the particles- this is determined by the brand label, and not
determined by the measurement process.</p></li>
<li><p>Area: Area of selection in square pixels or in calibrated square
units.</p></li>
<li><p>Perimeter (Perim.): The length of the outside boundary of the
selection. With Version IJ 1.44f and later, the perimeter of a composite
selection is calculated by decomposing it into individual sections. Note
that the composite perimeter and the sum of the individual perimeters
may be different due to use of different calculation methods.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Fit Ellipse Feature Set-</em></strong> The Ellipse
Fits command fits an ellipse to the selection.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Major: Major is the primary axis of the best fitting
ellipse.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor: Minor is the secondary axis of the best fitting
ellipse.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Shape Descriptors</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Circularity (Circ.): <span class="math inline">\(4\pi
\frac{Area}{Perimeter^2}\)</span> with a value of one indicating a
perfect circle. As the value approaches 0, it indicates an increasingly
elongated shape. Values may not be valid for very small
particles.</p></li>
<li><p>Aspect ratio (AR): The aspect ratio of the particle’s fitted
ellipse, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\frac{Major\  Axis}{Minor\
Axis}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Roundness (Round): The inverse of the Aspect Ratio.</p></li>
<li><p>Solidity: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{Area}{Convex\
Area}\)</span></p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The second and third data sets only contain the features from the
ImageJ software, namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>“Area”</p></li>
<li><p>“Perim.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Major”</p></li>
<li><p>“Minor”</p></li>
<li><p>“Circ.”</p></li>
<li><p>“AR”</p></li>
<li><p>“Round”</p></li>
<li><p>“Solidity”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>query</code> csv files contain particles from the recovered
IEDs. These data sets only have the following variables, with one
particle per row.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>“Area”</p></li>
<li><p>“Perim.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Major”</p></li>
<li><p>“Minor”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The recovered samples <code>query_3.csv</code>,
<code>query_9.csv</code>, <code>query_11.csv</code>, and
<code>query_12.csv</code> are from exploded IEDs. The other query
objects are from unexploded IEDs.</p>

<h3>Goals of the Project 3</h3>
<p>Build at least one predictive model that predicts whether or not a
particle is recovered from an exploded vs unexploded IED. Use the
developed model to explore Dr.&#160;Hietpas’ suspicion concerning the size of
particles recovered from an exploded IED.</p>

<h2>Required Commonents for the Submission</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For your submission provide the following components:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>Your slides presentation on your approach, summarizing your
recommendations, and conclusions. The main component of your assessment
will be a presentation of these slides over zoom.</p></li>
<li><p>The white paper report, with the methods you have used in
building your classifiers/methods.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li><p>You should use multiple methods and inference techniques; also
provide documentation on implementation and construction of each
methodology.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to provide an explaination on how you determined the
validity of Dr.&#160;Hietpas’ conjecture concerning the relationship between
the size of a particle and the chance that it was consumed after an
explosion.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to turn in the following three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>An annotated R-script/rmd that replicates your analysis for each
problem.</li>
<li>A write-up summarizing the methods. (White paper should have at most
2 pages of written text per query. Tables and plots do not count towards
the total page count but put tables/figures at the end of the write-up
and reference forward to them.)</li>
<li>A slides presentation discussing the work you have done on the
project. (Including the following: introduce and review the
problems/tasks; discuss the resources you have used to solve the
problem; present the algorithms and methods you used to solve the
problems/tasks; and your solutions/predictions with their corresponding
accuracy.)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Beware this is a rather open ended question.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Start early. Get something that works then come back and build up a
better solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good Luck</p>
